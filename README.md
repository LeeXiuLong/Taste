## Challenges Faced
1. None of the teammembers have been exposed to using third-party APIs. There were growing pains in learning how to implement the Google Places/Maps API. There were a plethora of resources online to refer to, however, they never seemed to quite fit the needs of our app development. Our team had to just dive head first and start testing with the resulting data did we figure out how to manipulate the data we needed to implement the API. One particular obstacle to overcome was the extraction of specific data when a query was being made.
